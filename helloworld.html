          <h2>Hey Guys This Is ALL About Me</h2>
          	       <p> My name is Kevin. I'm 19, Irish and studying Interaction Design at the University of Ulster Belfast. </p>
	       <p> I have recently started a part time job in a bar where i work till 2 or 3 in the morning and I rearly know what day it is.. but yeah it's all great. I'm sort of an nintendo nerd and do love alot of tv shows and movies, but mostly im a happy guy that loves my family, hanging out with friends, mountains of gorgeous food but also great design. </p>
